## Overview

The objective of this project is to build a model that can detect a specific trigger word from audio recordings. The model is trained using a neural network and can be used to activate voice-activated systems when the trigger word is detected.

## Installation

To get started with this project, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- TensorFlow
- Keras

You can install the required packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install numpy tensorflow keras
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/trigger-word-detection.git
cd trigger-word-detection
```

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook Trigger_word_detection.ipynb
```

3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to train and test the trigger word detection model.

## Notebook Details

The `Trigger_word_detection.ipynb` notebook includes the following key sections:

### Introduction

Overview of trigger word detection and the goals of the project.

### Data Preparation

- **Listening to the Data**: Understanding the audio data that will be used for training and testing.
- **From Audio Recordings to Spectrograms**: Converting audio clips into spectrograms for better feature extraction.
- **Generating a Single Training Example**: 
    - Benefits of synthesizing data: Speech data is hard to acquire and label, so the training data is synthesized using audio clips of activates, negatives, and backgrounds.
    - Process for Synthesizing an audio clip:
        - Pick a random 10-second background audio clip
        - Randomly insert 0-4 audio clips of "activate" into this 10-sec clip
        - Randomly insert 0-2 audio clips of negative words into this 10-sec clip
- **Full Training Set**: Creating a complete set of training data.
- **Development Set**: Preparing a set of development data for model validation.

### Model Architecture

- **Build the Model**: Constructing the neural network architecture.
- **Fit the Model**: Training the model with the prepared dataset.
- **Test the Model**: Evaluating the model's performance on the test dataset.

### Training

Details on the training process including the model fitting and parameter tuning.

### Evaluation

Methods and metrics used to evaluate the model's performance.

### Inference

Using the trained model to detect trigger words in new audio samples.
